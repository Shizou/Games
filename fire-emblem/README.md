Fire Emblem Anamalous
=====================
This was my final game related project. Here I tried to make my own version of the hit game
fire emblem made by Nintendo. In this game I incorporated several concepts like: generics,
artificial intelligence, inheritance, etc. I also made most of the images myself using adobe
photoshop.
